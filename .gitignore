#if you are not customizing a managed package, you can keep your 
#repository clean by ignoring all files for that package. 
#For example, to ignore all files of the "Copado" managed package
#just add to your .gitignore file the following text: *copado__*
#if you will be customizing managed packages, make sure that the 
#same version of the package is installed on all your environments 
#so that deployments will only update existing managed components. 
#Creation of managed components is not permitted by the API.
#It is recommended that you ignore managed components that cannot be 
#modified since there is no need to track them in Git, 
#like for example:

# classes/copado__*
# triggers/copado__*
# pages/copado__*

#profiles and permission sets are complex Files. If your Org's 
#metadata and Git are in sync, you can track incremental changes on 
#Profiles and Permission sets using Copado "commit files" functionality.
#Otherwise ignore profiles and permission sets until you are ready for it. 
#You can deploy profiles and permission sets using 
#Copado Deployer steps: Full profiles and Full Permission sets.
# Below is how to ignore them

# profiles/*
# permissionsets/*

#Translations are complex since get updated indirectly across
#multiple files, they can make a deployment fail if a field is 
#translated in source and it doesn't exist on destination. 
#If you are committing incrementally new fields and new Translations
#you can track them in Git, just be careful. 
#If you choose  to ignore them in Git, you can always create a deployment
#with the Copado Deployer "Translation" Step. 

# translations/*
# objectTranslations/*

#Sites which has Domain mapping has environment specific information. 
#Make sure you setup Copado Environment Variables to make sites config
#files environment agnostic.
#Until the above is achieved, you can ignore them as follows

# sites/*
# siteDotComSites/*
